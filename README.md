# Salingsapa

[![Codemagic build status](https://api.codemagic.io/apps/642645586c092f62d7cd27b1/642c4ec2aac5ee7954a0bf2e/status_badge.svg)](https://codemagic.io/apps/642645586c092f62d7cd27b1/642c4ec2aac5ee7954a0bf2e/latest_build)

Salingsapa is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) application designed to make video calls more
inclusive. The app focuses on improving communication for individuals with hearing impairments by
incorporating [Sign Language Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language_recognition)
and [Speech-to-Text](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/speech-to-text/) features. Built
following [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
principles and utilizing [BLoC state management](https://bloclibrary.dev/), Salingsapa ensures a
robust and scalable solution.

Enjoy seamless, high-quality video calls powered by [Agora](https://www.agora.io/en/) and supported
by a strong [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) backend. Salingsapa aims to make communication
easier and more accessible for everyone.

## üöÄ Features

### Inclusive Video Calls

- Conduct video calls with a unique emphasis on inclusivity.
- Features
  advanced [Sign Language Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language_recognition)
  and [Speech-to-Text](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/speech-to-text/) for enhanced communication.
- Seamless video calls powered by WebRTC with [Agora](https://www.agora.io/en/) for high-quality and
  efficient communication.

### Sign Language Recognition

- Employs [TensorFlowLite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) to recognize and interpret Sign Language
  gestures.
- Enhances communication for individuals with hearing impairments.

### Speech-to-Text Conversion

- Utilizes native Android and iOS APIs for
  real-time [Speech-to-Text](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/speech-to-text/) conversion.
- Converts spoken words into text to aid understanding during calls.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
